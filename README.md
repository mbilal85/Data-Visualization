# Data-Visualization
Creating this repository to include my work that I am doing on Seaborn and Matplotlib
In data visualization with Seaborn I will be using various datasets and constructing almost all the plot types offered by Seaborn ranging from KDE, regression plots, and categorical plots like matrix plots, factor plots, lm plots, pair plots and joint plots, so on and so forth.
I will also be using various seaborn styles, colors and techniques. Going through the seaborn library in detail has made me well versed to statistically analyze any data visually using visualization techniques.
