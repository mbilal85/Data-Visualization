# Seaborn is an important Python library for data analysis and statistical visualization. Seaborn integrates with the Python data science landscape by leveraging matplotlib and integrating with pandas. 
# 
# Codes are simple in Seaborn and their output gives strong statistical insights into data. 
# 
# In this document I will be using various datasets and construcing almost all the plot types offered by Seaborn ranging from KDE, regression plots, and categorical plots like matrix plots, factor plots, lm plots, pair plots and joint plots, so on and so forth. 
# 
# I will also be using various seaborn styles, colors and techniques. Going through the seaborn library in detail has made me well versed to statistically analyze any data visually using visualization techniues.

# Conducting Regression Analysis through visualization
# 
# Regression analysis is bivariate because it looks at relationship between two variables. 

# In[77]:


# Creating a regression plot of premiums vs. insurance_losses
sns.regplot(data=df1,
            x="insurance_losses",
            y="premiums")

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()


# The regression line hints that there will be an increase in premiums as insurance losses increase. The lower level regplot() and higher level lmplot() are similar. They produce the similar output. However, the lmplot is much more powerful. The use of hue and columns is a powerful concept that is present throughout many of Seabornâ€™s functions. The use of plotting multiple graphs while changing a single variable is often called faceting. Faceting can be accomplished by using lmplot() function. The base function is very similar to regplot() but it provides much more power by allowing us to add additional information using columns, colors or rows. Proceeding, I will be using the regplot() and lmplot() functions to analyze different datasets. 

# In[78]:


# Creating an lmplot of premiums vs. insurance_losses
sns.lmplot(data=df1,
           x="insurance_losses",
           y="premiums")

# Displaying the second plot
plt.show()


# The output looks similar. 

# In[79]:


# Creating a regression plot using hue
sns.lmplot(data=df1,
           x="insurance_losses",
           y="premiums",
           hue="Region")

# Showing the results
plt.show()


# The results are a bit difficult to read. Maybe using multiple lines is not the best approach. 

# In[80]:


# Create a regression plot with multiple rows
sns.lmplot(data=df1,
           x="insurance_losses",
           y="premiums",
           row="Region")

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# Faceting the data across multiple rows or columns can be a good way to see variable interactions in the data. The lmplot function supports plotting regression data by column, row and hue. This concept is used repeatedly throughout Seaborn.

fp = '/Users/MuhammadBilal/Desktop/Data Camp/Intermediate data visualization with seaborn/Data/rent.csv'


# In[176]:


df2 = pd.read_csv(fp)


# In[82]:


# Plotting the pandas histogram
df2['fmr_2'].plot.hist()
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Setting the default seaborn style
sns.set()

# Plotting the pandas histogram again
df2['fmr_2'].plot.hist()
plt.show()
plt.clf()


# ###### Comparing styles
# 
# Seaborn supports setting different styles that can control the aesthetics of the final plot. I will plot the same data in two different styles in order to see how the styles change the output.

# In[83]:


# Plotting with a dark style 
sns.set_style('dark')
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_2'])
plt.show()

# Clearing the figure
plt.clf()

# Plotting with a dark style 
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_2'])
plt.show()

# Clearing the figure
plt.clf()


# Seaborn's styles provide a quick and easy way to alter the visualizations in a consistent and visually appealing manner.

# ###### Removing spines
# 
# In general, visualizations should minimize extraneous markings so that the data speaks for itself. Seaborn allows us to remove the lines on the top, bottom, left and right axis, which are often called spines.
# 

# In[84]:


# Setting the style to white
sns.set_style('white')

# Creating a regression plot
sns.lmplot(data=df2,
           x='pop2010',
           y='fmr_2')

# Removing the spines
sns.despine(top=True, right=True)

# Showing the plot and clear the figure
plt.show()
plt.clf()


# Removing the spines lets the data speak for itself.

# ###### Matplotlib color codes
# 
# Seaborn offers several options for modifying the colors of your visualizations. The simplest approach is to explicitly state the color of the plot. A quick way to change colors is to use the standard matplotlib color codes.

# In[85]:


# Setting style, enable color code, and create a magenta distplot
sns.set(color_codes=True)
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_3'], color='m')

# Showing the plot
plt.show()


# This is a quick way to modify the colors of a plot.

# In[86]:


# Looping through differences between bright and colorblind palettes
for p in ['bright', 'colorblind']:
    sns.set_palette(p)
    sns.distplot(df2['fmr_3'])
    plt.show()
    
    # Clearing the plots
    plt.clf()


# Using the default color blind palette is a good option for making sure that the visualizations are easy to read for individuals with degrees of color blindness.

# ###### Creating Custom Palettes
# 
# Choosing a cohesive palette that works for the data can be time consuming. Fortunately, Seaborn has several functions that allows to create our own custom sequential, categorical, or diverging palettes. Seaborn also makes it easy to see the palettes by using the palplot() function.
# 

# In[69]:


# Creating and displaying a Purples sequential palette containing 8 colors.
sns.palplot(sns.color_palette('Purples', 8))
plt.show()

# Creating and displaying a palette with 10 colors using the husl system.
sns.palplot(sns.color_palette('husl', 10))
plt.show()

# Creating and displaying a diverging palette with 6 colors coolwarm.
sns.palplot(sns.color_palette('coolwarm', 6))
plt.show()


# Color palette possibilities are limitless. Using these helper functions allows to create unique and visually appealing plots that will stand out and get your points across.

# ###### Using matplotlib axes
# 
# Seaborn uses matplotlib as the underlying library for creating plots. Most of the time, we can use the Seaborn API to modify the visualizations but sometimes it is helpful to use matplotlib's functions to customize the plots. The most important object in this case is matplotlib's axes.
# 
# Once we have an axes object, we can perform a lot of customization of the plot.

# In[87]:


# Creating a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plotting the distribution of data
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_3'], ax=ax)

# Creating a more descriptive x axis label
ax.set(xlabel="3 Bedroom Fair Market Rent")

# Showing the plot
plt.show()


# ###### Additional plot customizations
# 
# The matplotlib API supports many common customizations such as labeling axes, adding titles, and setting limits. Let's do some more customization. 

# In[88]:


# Creating a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plotting the distribution of 1 bedroom rents
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_1'], ax=ax)

# Modifying the properties of the plot
ax.set(xlabel="1 Bedroom Fair Market Rent",
       xlim=(100,1500),
       ylabel="US Rent")

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()


# Making these types of customizations to the plots can really improve their impact.

# ###### Adding annotations
# 
# Each of the enhancements we have covered can be combined together. In the following code I will annotate the distribution plot to include lines that show the mean and median rent prices.
# 
# For this example, the palette has been changed to bright using sns.set_palette()

# In[89]:


# Creating a figure and axes. Then plot the data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_1'], ax=ax)

# Customizing the labels and limits
ax.set(xlabel="1 Bedroom Fair Market Rent", xlim=(100,1500), title="US Rent")

mean = df2['fmr_1'].mean()
median = df2['fmr_1'].median()

# Adding vertical lines for the median and mean
ax.axvline(x=median, color='m', label='Median', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)
ax.axvline(x=mean, color='b', label='Mean', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)

# Showing the legend and plot the data
ax.legend()
plt.show()


# ###### Multiple plots
# 
# Finally I will plot a comparison of the fair market rents for 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments.
# 

# In[90]:


# Creating a plot with 1 row and 2 columns that share the y axis label
fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, sharey=True)

# Plotting the distribution of 1 bedroom apartments on ax0
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_1'], ax=ax0)
ax0.set(xlabel="1 Bedroom Fair Market Rent", xlim=(100,1500))

# Plotting the distribution of 2 bedroom apartments on ax1
sns.distplot(df2['fmr_2'], ax=ax1)
ax1.set(xlabel="2 Bedroom Fair Market Rent", xlim=(100,1500))

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()


# ###### Stripplot() and swarmplot()
# 
# Many datasets have categorical data and Seaborn supports several useful plot types for this data. In the following example, I will continue to look at the 2010 School Improvement data and segment the data by the types of school improvement models used.
# 

# In[95]:


# Creating a stripplot of the Award_Amount with the Model Selected on the y axis with jitter enabled.

# Create the stripplot
sns.stripplot(data=df,
         x='Award_Amount',
         y='Model Selected',
         jitter=True)

plt.show()

# Creating a swarmplot() of the same data, but also include the hue by Region.

# Creating and display a swarmplot with hue set to the Region
sns.swarmplot(data=df,
         x='Award_Amount',
         y='Model Selected',
         hue='Region')

plt.show()


# ###### Categorical Plot Types
# 
# Categorical data is data which includes a limited or fixed number of values and is most useful when combined with numeric data. Seaborn breaks categorical data plots into three groups. 
# 
# The first group includes the stripplot() and swarmplot(), which show all the individual observations on the plot. 
# 
# The second category contains the familiar boxplot(), as well as the violinplot() and the lvplot(). These plots show an abstract representation of the categorical data. 
# 
# The final group of plots show statistical estimates of the categorical variables. 
# 
# The barplot() and pointplot() contain useful summaries of data. 
# 
# The countplot() shows number of instances of each observation. 
# 
# Stripplot() shows every observation in the dataset. In some cases, it can be difficult to see individual data points. We can use swarmplot() that uses a complex algorithm to place the observations in a manner where they do not overlap. The downside of this approach is that the swarmplot() does not scale well to large datasets. 
# 
# The next category of plots show abstract representation of the data. A boxplot() is the most common of this type. This plot is used to show several measures related to the distribution of data, including the median, upper and lower quartiles, as well as outliers. 
# 
# The violinplot() is a combination of kernel density plot and a box plot and can be suitable for providing an alternative view of the distribution of data. Because the plot uses a kernel density calculation it does not show all data points. This can be useful for displaying large datasets but it can be computationally intensive to create. 
# 
# The final plot in the grouping is the lvplot() which stands for Letter Value plot. It scales more effectively to large datasets. The lvplot() is a hybrid between a boxplot() and violinplot() and is relatively quick to render and easy to interpret. 
# 
# The final category of plots are statistical estimates of the data. The barplot() shows an estimate of the value as well as confidence interval. 
# 
# The pointplot() is similar to the barplot() in that it shows a summary measure and confidence interval. A pointplot() can be very useful for observing how values change across categorical values. The final categorical plot is the countplot() which displays the number of instances of each variable. 
# 

# ###### Boxplots, violinplots and lvplots
# 
# Seaborn's categorical plots also support several abstract representations of data. The API for each of these is the same so it is very convenient to try each plot and see if the data lends itself to one over the other.
# 
# I will use the color palette options to show how colors can easily be included in the plots.

# In[97]:


# Creating and displaying a boxplot of the data with Award_Amount on the x axis and Model Selected on the y axis.

# Creating a boxplot
sns.boxplot(data=df,
         x='Award_Amount',
         y='Model Selected')

plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Creating and display a similar violinplot of the data, but use the husl palette for colors.

# Creating a violinplot with the husl palette
sns.violinplot(data=df,
         x='Award_Amount',
         y='Model Selected',
         palette='husl')

plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Creating and display an lvplot using the Paired palette and the Region column as the hue.
# Creating a lvplot with the Paired palette and the Region column as the hue
sns.lvplot(data=df,
         x='Award_Amount',
         y='Model Selected',
         palette='Paired',
         hue='Region')

plt.show()
plt.clf()


# Seaborn's API makes it very simple to create multiple abstract representations of categorical data.

# ###### Barplots, pointplots and countplots
# 
# The final group of categorical plots are barplots, pointplots and countplot which create statistical summaries of the data. The plots follow a similar API as the other plots and allow further customization for the specific problem at hand.

# In[98]:


# Creating a countplot with the df dataframe and Model Selected on the y axis and the color varying by Region.

# Showing a countplot with the number of models used with each region a different color
sns.countplot(data=df,
         y="Model Selected",
         hue="Region")

plt.show()
plt.clf()


# Creating a pointplot with the df dataframe and Model Selected on the x-axis and Award_Amount on the y-axis.
# Using a capsize in the pointplot in order to show the confidence interval.

# Creating a pointplot and include the capsize in order to show bars on the confidence interval
sns.pointplot(data=df,
         y='Award_Amount',
         x='Model Selected',
         capsize=.1)

plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Creating a barplot with the same data on the x and y axis and change the color of each bar based on the Region column.

# Creating a barplot with each Region shown as a different color
sns.barplot(data=df,
         y='Award_Amount',
         x='Model Selected',
         hue='Region')

plt.show()
plt.clf()


# The pointplot and barplot can be useful visualizations for understanding the variations of categorical data.

# ###### Regression Plots
# 
# Seabornâ€™s regression plotting tools can be used to evaluate the data from multiple perspectives and look for relationships between these numeric variables. The function requires the definition of the data and the x and y variables. 
# 
# 
# The residual plot is a very useful plot for understanding the appropriateness of a regression model. Ideally the residual values in the plot should be plotted randomly across the horizontal line. If a value greater than 1 is passed to the order parameter of regplot() then Seaborn will attempt a polynomial fit using underlying NumPy functions. The residual plot can interpret the second order polynomial and plot the residual values. If the values are more randomly distributed, a second order equation is likely more appropriate for the problem. 
# 
# 
# Seaborn also supports regression plots with categorical variables. The jitter parameter makes it easier to see the individual distributions of the categorical variables. In some cases even with the jitter it is difficult to see any trends based on the values of the variables. Using an estimator for the x value can provide another helpful view of the data. When there are continuous variables, it can be helpful to break them into different bins. 
# 
# 
# Seabornâ€™s regplot() function supports several parameters for creating highly customized regression plots.

# ###### Matrix Plots
# 
# The heatmap is the most common type of matrix plot and can be easily created by Seaborn. These type of matrix plots can be useful for quickly seeing trends in a dataset. One common usage for heatmap is to visually represent the correlation between variables. Seabornâ€™s heatmap() function expects the data to be in a matrix. The heatmap translates the numerical values in the matrix into a color coded grid. The colors get lighter as the numbers increase. 
# 
# The display of the heatmap can be customized in multiple ways to present the most information as clearly as possible. 
# 
# The plot shows the strength of correlation between different variables. The visualization can be useful to understand which variables you might want to further study using regplot().

# ###### Building a FacetGrid
# 
# Seaborn's FacetGrid is the foundation for building data-aware grids. A data-aware grid allows you to create a series of small plots that can be useful for understanding complex data relationships.
# 
# I will continue to look at the College Scorecard Data from the US Department of Education. This rich dataset has many interesting data elements that we can plot with Seaborn.
# 
# When building a FacetGrid, there are two steps:
# 
#  - Creating a FacetGrid object with columns, rows, or hue.
# 
#  - Mapping individual plots to the grid.

# In[116]:


# Creating FacetGrid with Degree_Type and specify the order of the rows using row_order
g2 = sns.FacetGrid(df3, 
             row="Degree_Type",

# ###### Using a factorplot

# ###### Using a lmplot
# 
# The lmplot is used to plot scatter plots with regression lines on FacetGrid objects. The API is similar to factorplot with the difference that the default behavior of lmplot is to plot regression lines.
# 
# First I will look at the Undergraduate population (UG) and compare it to the percentage of students receiving Pell Grants (PCTPELL).
# 
# For the second lmplot I will look at the relationships between Average SAT scores and Tuition across the different degree types and public vs. non-profit schools.

# ###### Additional pairplots
# 
# I am going through a couple of more examples of how the pairplot() can be customized for quickly analyzing data and determining areas of interest that might be worthy of additional analysis.
# 
# One area of customization that is useful is to explicitly defining the x_vars and y_vars that we wish to examine. Instead of examining all pairwise relationships, this capability allows us to look only at the specific interactions that may be of interest.
# 
# We have already looked at using kind to control the types of plots. We can also use diag_kind to control the types of plots shown on the diagonals. In the final example, we will include a regression and kde plot in the pairplot.

# ###### JointGrid and Jointplot
# 
# A JointGrid() allows us to compare the distribution of data between two variables. A JointGrid() makes use of scatter plots, regression lines as well as histograms, distribution plots, and kernel density estimates to give us insight into our data. Jointgrid() takes a small number of inputs and creates an insightful visualization of the data. Jointgrid() depicts relationship between two variables. The centre of the plot contains a scatter plot of these two variables. The plots along the x and y-axis show the distribution of the data for each variable. The plot can be configured by specifying the type of joint plots as well as the marginal plots. 
# 
# Hex plot is also a method to demonstrate the relationship between the two variables. Seaborn automatically includes the Pearson r correlation in this plot. 
# 
# The jointplot() supports simple creation of scatter, hex, residual, regression, and kde plots. It can also support adding overlay plots to enhance the final output. We can also set limit of a variable on x-axis. By including the plot_joint() function, a kde plot is overlaid on the scatter plot. This combination of plots is useful for understanding the areas where variables have natural groupings. 
# 

# ###### Building a JointGrid and jointplot
# 
# Seaborn's JointGrid combines univariate plots such as histograms, rug plots and kde plots with bivariate plots such as scatter and regression plots. These plots also demonstrate how Seaborn provides convenient functions to combine multiple plots together.
# 
# I will use the bike share data. I will look at the relationship between humidity levels and total rentals to see if there is an interesting relationship we might want to explore later.

# Based on the residual plot and the pearson r value, there is a positive relationship between temperature and total_rentals.

# ###### Complex jointplots
# 
# The jointplot is a convenience wrapper around many of the JointGrid functions. However, it is possible to overlay some of the JointGrid plots on top of the standard jointplot. In this example, we can look at the different distributions for riders that are considered casual versus those that are registered.
